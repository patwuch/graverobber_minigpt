# graverobber_minigpt


This repository contains the code used to clean and tokenise the popular Chinese novel series "Grave Robbers' Chronicles". It examines the performance of three different popular Chinese word segmentation and tokenisation libraries (Jieba, Stanza, and BERT-chinese-base) in the context of creating a mini GPT that generates random sentences that would mimic the content and style of the series.
